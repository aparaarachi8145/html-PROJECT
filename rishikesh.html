        <p><b>Located in the foothills of the Himalayas along the convergence of Ganga and Chandrabhaga River, Rishikesh
                is a small town in the Dehradun district, located close to Haridwar in Uttarakhand. Rishikesh (also
                called as Hrishikesh) is known for its adventure activities, ancient temples, popular cafes and as the
                "Yoga Capital of the World". Gateway to Garhwal Himalayas, Rishikesh is also a pilgrimage town and one
                of the holiest places for Hindus.

                Rishikesh became known worldwide in the 1960s after The Beatles visited the ashram of Maharishi Mahesh
                Yogi here. Today, the place is popular as The Beatles Ashram which beckons tourists globally. The
                tranquil town has long been a spiritual centre but is equally popular for the whitewater rafting, bungee
                jumping, mountain biking and camping along the fast-flowing Holy Ganges. It also serves as the gateway
                to many Himalayan treks.</b></p>
