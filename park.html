    <h1><b><u>NANDA DEVI NATIONAL PARK</u></b></h1>
    <div>
        <p> <b>In proximity to Nanda Devi, which is the second highest peak in India, lies the Nanda Devi National Park
                in the Chamoli district of Uttarakhand. A UNESCO World Heritage Site, this park is one of the most
                biodiverse regions in the world and is home to some of the rarest and unique high-altitude flora and
                fauna in the world. The breathtaking views, coupled with the richness of biosphere, set this national
                park aside from all others that are located in the country.

                The area was given the status of a national park in the year 1982 to protect and conserve the exotic
                flora and fauna in the region and to save it from further environmental degradation. Today, the Nanda
                Devi National Park is one of the most important ecological hotspots of the world and is home to a
                variety of birds, mammals, plants, trees and butterflies. </b></p>
