        <p> <b>Shared between India and Bangladesh, the Sundarbans meaning beautiful forest, was declared a UNESCO
                heritage site in 1984. This area has a quiet charm that amazes visitors with the simplicity and
                uniqueness of its ecological balance despite offering habitat to some of the most dynamic and
                awe-inspiring flora and fauna. These forests are, in fact, the last remaining stands of the mighty
                jungles which once covered the Gangetic plains. Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a wildlife
                sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are over 400 Royal Bengal Tigers residing in it.

                This forest has the largest number of Sundari trees. Sundarbans epitomize wilderness with its meandering
                rivers, springs, creeks and estuaries. It was a declared Tiger Reserve, home to the Royal Bengal Tiger -
                an almost extinct species that swim in the saline water and are often called man-eaters.</b></p>
