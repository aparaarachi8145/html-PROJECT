            Valley of Flowers is located in Chamoli district (near Badrinath) of Uttarakhand, approximately 300 km to
            the north of Rishikesh. Valley of flowers is a World Heritage Site for its wild untamed blooms surrounded by
            white peaks. It is open from June to September every year.

            At the meeting point of the Himalayan ranges, Zanskar and Western and Eastern Himalayas, the valley of
            flowers discovered by Mountaineer Frank S Smith in 1931 has been declared a world heritage site for its wild
            untamed blooms surrounded by white peaks. Famous for its exotic varieties of medicinal herbs, it is also
            believed that Hanuman brought Sanjivani to the ailing Lakshmana from the valley of flowers. A perfect place
            to laze around the umpteen number of Himalayan water-falls, streams and paddocks and let the beauty of the
            place sink in.
